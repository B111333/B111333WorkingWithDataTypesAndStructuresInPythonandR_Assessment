## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Load packages and data
Letâ€™s load the packages and data needed for this script.

```{r a,message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(NHSRdatasets)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r a,message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
Height <- c(1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.5) # height data in m
Weight <- c(50, 60, 64, 95)     # weight data in kg
BMI <-   Weight/(Height^2)      # BMI
cbind(Height , Weight, BMI) # column bind, like spreadsheet
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
